# Appointment-No-Show-Analysis
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset using T-SQL queries, analyzing patient no-show rates, demographics, and appointment scheduling patterns. Generated insights to aid in decision-making and improve patient outcomes. 

This dataset contains information about patients and their appointments in a medical center in Brazil. The dataset includes information such as the patient's age, gender, medical history, and whether or not they attended their scheduled appointment.

Findings:

1. There were more female patients than male patients in the dataset.
2. Most patients did not have a scholarship, hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disability.
3. About one-third of the appointments were missed by patients.
4. The age of the patients ranged from 0 to 115 years, with the median age being 37 years.
5. There were some patients with age 0, which may be due to missing or incorrect data.
6. The most common neighborhood in the dataset was Jardim Camburi, followed by Maria Ortiz and ResistÃªncia.
7. Patients with a scholarship were more likely to miss their appointments than patients without a scholarship.
8. Patients who received SMS notifications were slightly more likely to show up for their appointments than patients who did not receive SMS notifications.
9. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disability were more likely to show up for their appointments than patients without these conditions.
10. There were more appointments on weekdays than on weekends, with Wednesday being the most common day for appointments.
11. There were some appointments where the scheduled date was after the appointment date, which may be due to errors in the data.

Suggestions:

1. Offer discounts or rewards to patients with a scholarship who show up for their appointments.
2. Send more frequent or personalized SMS notifications to remind patients of their appointments.
3. Provide education and resources to help patients manage their conditions, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disability.
4. Schedule appointments at times that are more convenient for patients, such as weekends.
5. Improve the accuracy and completeness of the data to minimize errors and inconsistencies.

Limitations:

1. The dataset is limited to one medical center in Brazil, so the findings may not be applicable to other settings or countries.
2. The dataset only includes information about appointments made within a specific time period, which may not be representative of appointments made at other times.
3. The dataset is based on patient self-report, which may not always be accurate or complete.
4. The dataset does not include information about the severity of patients' conditions or the urgency of their appointments.
