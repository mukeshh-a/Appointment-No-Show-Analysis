To summarize the analysis, we can look at the findings and insights from the queries we have run on the dataset. Based on the queries, here are some possible findings and suggestions:

1. Overall, there were more female patients than male patients in the dataset.
2. Most patients did not have a scholarship, hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disability.
3. About one-third of the appointments were missed by patients.
4. The age of the patients ranged from 0 to 115 years, with the median age being 37 years.
5. There were some patients with age 0, which may be due to missing or incorrect data.
6. The most common neighbourhood in the dataset was Jardim Camburi, followed by Maria Ortiz and ResistÃªncia.
7. Patients with a scholarship were more likely to miss their appointments than patients without a scholarship.
8. Patients who received SMS notifications were slightly more likely to show up for their appointments than patients who did not receive SMS notifications.
9. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disability were more likely to show up for their appointments than patients without these conditions.
10. There were more appointments on weekdays than on weekends, with Wednesday being the most common day for appointments.
11. There were some appointments where the scheduled date was after the appointment date, which may be due to errors in the data.

Based on these findings, some possible suggestions for improving appointment attendance rates include:

1. Offering discounts or rewards to patients with a scholarship who show up for their appointments.
2. Sending more frequent or personalized SMS notifications to remind patients of their appointments.
3. Providing education and resources to help patients manage their conditions, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, or disability.
4. Scheduling appointments at times that are more convenient for patients, such as weekends.
5. Improving the accuracy and completeness of the data to minimize errors and inconsistencies.
